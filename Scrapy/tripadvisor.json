We had a good view of the water from our room. Room was clean and had everything we needed. I also appreciated the fresh fruit.  Hotel pool on 18th floor is lovely and provides great views of the city through the glass walls of the pool. There is also a balcony near the pool where you can relax and enjoy the view over the Singapore skyline. The pool was my favourite spot, and very refreshing in hot weather.</span>"},

To begin with the good; the room sizing is generous, the hotel is well situated and it was easy to get taxis to and from the establishment. However, the breakfast was subpar and expensive, the staff struggled with simple tasks (e.g. ordering water) and whoever was filling the bins outside would spend a good half an hour banging about in the middle of the night (heard from 6 stories up). In my opinion, the biggest issue with this hotel is how dated it is compared to the more modern and similarly priced alternatives in the area.</span>"},

The only area of improvement is the pool which could be centrally heated and/or covered the water on most days was freezing. Lack of room servicing on holidays and lack of F&amp;B onsite can be an issue.  Overall highly recommend especially for a family if looking for a pad to explore the city.</span>"},

We were both really impressed by this place. The door man was extremely professional and very easy to talk to. He was most helpful every time we saw and spoke to him. We had a very lovely lady check us in who was again easy to talk to and seemed genuinely happy. The room was lovely, really comfy bed and lovely shower. We even took a dip in the pool which is a strange experience swimming up amounst the office buildings but really cool as well.

First, location is wonderful.  The Raffles Place MRT, taking you almost anywhere, is next to the hotel.  We first purchased a three day tourist pass and then converted it to another two day pass. Passes available at Raffles Place ticket counter and must be extended at the same location.  You get 10SG back if you return the card at expiration.  Lau Pa Sat is an easy block away.  We ate amazing lunch and dinner so very cheaply.   Hints: 1. either do early or late lunch.  Noon to one is crazy busy Monday-Friday.  2. Use a Kleenex pack to save your seat.  3. Bring plenty of Kleenex and wet ones.  Marina Bay Sands, Merlion Park, Gardens by the Bay all easy walks.   Second, apartment had everything we</span>"},

Before my arrival, staff emailed me for my preferred welcome fruits, and granted my usual request for a corner room. Aside from the delicate plates, utensils, pots, and pans, the refrigerator, conduction oven and stove, I really love the fully automatic washing machine that comes with a daily supply of powdered laundry detergent.

The toilet is one of a kind. It\u2019s gorgeous and it\u2019s big! And the toiletries are all from l\u2019occitane. I can\u2019t help it but took a video. However the room that I gotten has no view at all but a wall from the opposite building so kinda boring. Considering it\u2019s a suite type of room and pricey I expected for a good view. Good thing is we stayed to sleep only. For the design of their swimming pool, it doesn\u2019t attract us to soak from it so we skipped swimming in. There is no breakfast inclusion also. For the price I paid and if I book in the hotel I\u2019ll surely have great</span>"},

The room had nice versions of all the standard amenities: stove, microwave, refrigerator, big freezer, safe in a draw (cannot fit more than two laptops), washer dryer, dish washer, counter appliances, and kitchen outfitting. The bed was comfortable. The room was quiet. I slept great. Boat and Clark Quay are short walks away through air-conditioned undergrounds.

The taxi driver did not know the hotel because they refer to it with a different name.  We had to give him the address to take us there.  Surprisingly, we found the location to be great for many of the attractions; shopping, sightseeing, business and MRT.  The view from our room was terrible, but it was a big room which kind of made up for the view. It was very quiet; which is typical of Singapore compared to neighboring countries.   A slight disappointment was the unavailability of a room with twin beds.  However the large king size bed was very comfortable.  They provided coffee and tea with plenty of water.  There was a huge shower and plenty of closet space with lots of hangers.  All the positive aspects could not make us ignore</span>"},

Own washer/dryer, lounge out area, king size bed, bath etc. As a serviced apartment you get less service over weekends (usually a non-issue for business) and you also don\u2019t get 24 hour room service. The room service that is available is via the restaurant in the same building but you need to pay as you go it cannot go on room bill. All in all happy with this spot and will return (as a frequent Singapore visitor for work). Only gripe is the increase in price for staying should you want to book in person or over the phone - I was told best to go online or use a third party online hotel booking platform...</span>"},

The swimming pool has a spectacular view, and people can work on their muscles at the gym beside the pool operating at 24hours a day. Anyone who enjoys reading definitely have to visit their living room as theres a variety of books to choose from! Amenities in the room was also well provided, bathroom was big and spacious. Overall, I enjoyed my stay at Ascott Raffles Place, and will definitely be back soon ! </span>"},

None of the windows opened, but it was so muggy outside I wouldn't have wanted it anyway.  Second, the bathing area was huge, commanding an entire tiled room, in which there were three shower heads and an enormous bath. It felt like a private sauna!

And best of all is the staff, I've never felt so welcomed - every single one of them was very professional, super helpful and always attended to me with a great smile. There isn't a single thing that I could complain about the Ascott - highly recommend the place for any kind of traveling!</span>"},

The MRT is right outside the hotel, so all you have to do is hop out of the hotel and get down the subway to take the train. The single rooms are quite large and can easily accommodate 4 pax and they have lovely homely feel to them, so even away on work i feel at home.</span>"},

The only minor drawback is that there is no business centre but there's a copy/print shop about 2 minutes away so that wasn't too much of a drama.

The Ascott is 3 minutes walk from the river, easy access to the MRT (tube) and a short cab ride to Orchard road. The price is right for the amount of space you get. It's clean, reasonably well stocked in the kitchen to cook something fairly basic and have breakfast and has a decent Bose sound system in the room. Don't expect something cutting edge and modern...it isn't. The breakfast area is basic but functional and the checki /check out can be a bit of a chore at peak times...but it still gets 4/5 for its location, space and price.</span>"},

The wireless internet works flawlessly and it was not billed separately. The staff is very non-intrusive and the location is right in the heart of the CBD next to Lau Pa Sat.

Although the Asia Insurance Company no longer resides in this building, the A.I Building remained as a significant landmark in Singapore\u2019s Building History when it overtook Cathay Building upon completion.

Location  is subjective as if you are looking for shopping, there is only the Marina Bay sands which is about 15 to 20 minutes walk away.

Service wise, there is not much to speak of as its a serviced apartment and not a full fledged hotel. The rooms are clean and huge. They have a mini kitchen for you to cook and wash your dishes. Oven and fridge can be found in the room as well.   On level 2, there is actually a coffee machine and therefore, one can proceed there for a free cup of coffee anytime during the stay.

Because of the apartment-istic nature of the residences, there wasn't any room service, but the hotel was located near to Lau Pa Sat, which is a decent food-stall-like place.

Don't expect too much of the Bose sound system either.
